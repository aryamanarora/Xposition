# Xposition

__Xposition__ (URL forthcoming) is a multilingual database of the semantics of adpositions (prepositions, postpositions) and case markers.
Semantic information is primarily categorized in terms of coarse-grained __supersenses__. 
The database is designed to support corpus annotation.

Xposition is the successor to [PrepWiki](http://demo.ark.cs.cmu.edu/PrepWiki/), which was limited to English prepositions
and used an earlier inventory of supersenses.
