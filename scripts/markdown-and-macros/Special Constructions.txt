This section discusses notable constructions that are not limited to a single supersense.

##Genitives/Possessives

(blodgett-18) detail the application of this scheme to English possessive constructions:
the so-called **s-genitive**, as in [exref 001 Special_Constructions], and
**of-genitive**, as in [exref 003 Special_Constructions]:



- [ex 001 "<u>the Smith family[p en/'s Possessor]</u>/<u>[p en/their Possessor]</u> house ([ss Possessor])"]

- [ex 002 "<u>the tea[p en/'s Gestalt]</u>/<u>[p en/its Gestalt]</u> price ([ss Gestalt])"]



- [ex 003 "the house [p en/of Possessor] the Smith family ([ss Possessor])"]

- [ex 004 "the price [p en/of Gestalt] the tea ([ss Gestalt])"]

Note that the s-genitive is realized with case marking (clitic [p en/'s] or possessive pronoun[^1])
rather than a preposition,
and the case-marked NP in the s-genitive alternates with the object of the preposition in the of-genitive.
(This may feel unintuitive: annotators looking at the s-genitive construction are often tempted to focus on
the role occupied by the head noun rather than the case-marked noun.)

The s-genitive and of-genitive are particularly associated with
[ss Possessor] (which applies to a canonical form of possession)
and the more general category [ss Gestalt]; both supersenses are illustrated above [exref 001 Special_Constructions], [exref 003 Special_Constructions].
In addition, both genitive constructions can mark participant roles and other kinds of relations,
including [ss Whole] and [ss SocialRel] relations.
When the s-genitive is used, the <i>function</i> is always either [ss Gestalt] (most cases)
or [ss Possessor] (when the possession is sufficiently canonical).
While overlapping in scene roles with the s-genitive,
[p en/of] is considered compatible with some additional functions,
including [ss Whole], [ss Source], and [ss Theme]; thus of-genitives
with such roles do not need to be construed as [ss Gestalt] or [ss Possessor]:

[ss SocialRel--Gestalt]:

- [ex 005 "the grandfather [p en/of Gestalt] Lord Voldemort"]

- [ex 006 "<u>Lord Voldemort[p en/'s Gestalt]</u>/<u>[p en/his Gestalt]</u> grandfather"]



- [ex 007 "the hood [p en/of Whole] the car ([ss Whole])"]

- [ex 008 "the nose [p en/of Whole] He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ([ss Whole])"]

- [ex 009 "<u>the car[p en/'s Whole--Gestalt] hood</u>/<u>[p en/its Whole--Gestalt]</u> ([ss Whole--Gestalt])"]

- [ex 010 "<u>He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named[p en/'s Whole--Gestalt] nose</u>/<u>[p en/his Whole--Gestalt]</u> ([ss Whole--Gestalt])"]



- [ex 011 "the arrival [p en/of Theme] the queen ([ss Theme])"]

- [ex 012 "<u>the queen[p en/'s Theme--Gestalt] arrival</u>/<u>[p en/her Theme--Gestalt]</u> ([ss Theme--Gestalt])"]

- [ex 013 "<u>Shakespeare[p en/'s Originator--Gestalt]</u>/<u>[p en/his Originator--Gestalt]</u> works ([ss Originator--Gestalt])"]

- [ex 014 "These are children[p en/'s Beneficiary--Possessor] clothes.[^2] [clothes intended for use and possession by children] ([ss Beneficiary--Possessor])"]

The literature on the genitive alternation examines the factors that condition
the choice of construction; important factors include the length and animacy of the possessed NP.
In addition, [p en/of] participates in certain constructions that are not really possessives—e.g. <i>this sort [p en/of] sweater</i> ([ss Species]).

Certain idioms require an s-genitive argument that does not participate in
any transparent semantic relationship; for these, [ss `$] is used ([[ Special_Labels]]).

##Passives

The construction for passive voice (in verbs and nominalizations thereof)
involves an optional [p en/by]-PP;
the object of [p en/by] alternates with the subject in active voice.
While a variety of scene roles can be expressed with this phrase,
the <i>functions</i> associated with passive [p en/by] are limited to
[ss Agent] and [ss Causer]:

- [ex 015 "the decisive vote [p en/by Agent] the City Council ([ss Agent])"]

- [ex 016 "the devastation wreaked [p en/by Causer] the fire ([ss Causer])"]

- [ex 017 "This story was told [p en/by Originator--Agent] my grandmother. ([ss Originator--Agent])"]

- [ex 018 "The news was not well received [p en/by Recipient--Agent] the White House. ([ss Recipient--Agent])"]

- [ex 019 "Mr. Dursley is employed [p en/by OrgRole--Agent] Grunnings. ([ss OrgRole--Agent])"]

- [ex 020 "The window was broken [p en/by Instrument--Causer] the hammer. ([ss Instrument--Causer])"]

- [ex 021 "scared [p en/by Stimulus--Causer] the bear ([ss Stimulus--Causer])"]

##Comparatives and Superlatives

Various constructions express a comparison between two arguments.

- **[ss ComparisonRef] for second argument.**
When the second argument (the point of reference)
is adpositionally marked, [ss ComparisonRef] is used, regardless of
its complement’s syntactic type:

- [ex 022 "Your face is as red [p en/as ComparisonRef] <u>a rose</u>/<u>mine is</u>. ([ss ComparisonRef])"]

- [ex 023 "Your face is redder [p en/than ComparisonRef] <u>a rose</u>/<u>mine is</u>. ([ss ComparisonRef])"]

See further examples at [ss ComparisonRef].

### [p en/as] -[p en/as] comparative construction 
- **[ss Extent] argument.**
In an [p en/as]-[p en/as] comparison, the scene role of the first argument
(the object of the first [p en/as]) is the role that would be operative
if the construction were removed and only the first argument remained:
e.g., <i>I stayed as long as I could</i> → <i>I stayed long</i>.
The function of the first [p en/as] is always [ss Extent]
to reflect that it marks the degree on a scale:



- [ex 024 "I helped [p en/as Extent] much as I could. ([ss Extent])"]

- [ex 025 "Your face is [p en/as Characteristic--Extent] red as a rose. ([ss Characteristic--Extent])"]

- [ex 026 "I helped [p en/as Manner--Extent] carefully as I could. ([ss Manner--Extent])"]

- [ex 027 "I stayed [p en/as Duration--Extent] long as I could. ([ss Duration--Extent])"]

- [ex 028 "I helped [p en/as Frequency--Extent] often as I could. ([ss Frequency--Extent])"]

- [ex 029 "I’ve eaten (twice) [p en/as Approximator--Extent] much (food) as you. [amount of something]  ([ss Approximator--Extent])"]

- **Second argument: [ss ComparisonRef].**
See [exref 022 Special_Constructions] above.

###Superlatives 
[ss Whole] is used for the superset or gestalt licensed by a superlative:

- [ex 030 "the youngest [p en/of Whole] the children ([ss Whole])"]

See more at [ss Whole].

##Infinitive Clauses

In its function as infinitive marker, [p en/to] is not generally considered to be a preposition.
Nevertheless, we consider all uses of [p en/to] for adposition supersense annotation
because infinitive clauses (infinitivals) can express similar semantic relations
as prepositional phrases. Most notably, infinitival purpose adjuncts alternate
with [p en/for]-PP purpose adjuncts:

[ss Purpose]:



- [ex 031 "Open the door [p en/to Special_Constructions] let in some air."]

- [ex 032 "Open the door [p en/for Special_Constructions] some air."]



- [ex 033 "I flew to headquarters [p en/to Special_Constructions] meet with the principals."]

- [ex 034 "I flew to headquarters [p en/for Special_Constructions] a meeting with the principals."]

Thus, from a practical point of view, we might as well treat infinitival [p en/to]
as capable of marking a [ss Purpose].

The following is an exhaustive list of semantic analyses that we consider for infinitivals:

###1. **Purpose adjuncts**, generally adverbial, as in [exref 031 Special_Constructions].
These are labeled [ss Purpose]. They can generally be paraphrased with [p en/in_order_to].

###2. **Inherent purposes**, generally adnominal, as in [exref 014 Purpose], described under [ss Purpose].
These are labeled [ss Characteristic--Purpose].

###3. In a **commercial scene**, that which costs money; labeled [ss Theme--Purpose].
Repeated from the discussion under [ss Theme]:



- [ex 035 "They asked $500 [p en/to Theme--Purpose] make the repairs. ([ss Theme--Purpose])"]

- [ex 036 "$500 [p en/to Theme--Purpose] make the repairs was excessive. ([ss Theme--Purpose])"]

###4. Constructions of **sufficiency and excess**—<i>too short [p en/to] ride</i>, <i>not tall enough [p en/to] ride</i>, etc., where the assertion of sufficiency or excess
licenses an infinitival, labeled [ss ComparisonRef--Purpose].
See discussion at [ss ComparisonRef].


Infinitival tokens not covered by this list are labeled [ss `i] ([[ Special_Labels]]).

- **Infinitival with [p en/for]-subject.**
In [exref 031 Special_Constructions], the infinitive clause has no local subject—rather,
an argument of the matrix clause doubles as the subject of the infinitive clause
(control). However, a separate subject can be introduced with [p en/for],
in which case [p en/for]+NP is treated as a dependent of the infinitive verb
and labeled [ss `i]:



- [ex 037 "I opened the door [[p en/for Special_Constructions]<sub>[ss `i]</sub> Steve [p en/to Special_Constructions]<sub>[ss Purpose]</sub> take out the trash]."]

- [ex 038 "It cost $500 [[p en/for Special_Constructions]<sub>[ss `i]</sub> the mechanic [p en/to Special_Constructions]<sub>[ss Theme--Purpose]</sub> make the repairs]."]

##PP Idioms

Many PPs exhibit some amount of lexicalization or idiomaticity.
This is especially true of PPs that tend to be used predicatively.
In general it is extremely difficult to establish tests to distinguish idiomatic PPs
from fully productive combinations.
However, the usual criteria apply for the supersense analysis.

For example, if the PP answers a <i>Where?</i> question,
it qualifies as [ss Locus];
whereas qualitative states usually have [ss Manner] as the scene role:

- [ex 039 "He is [p en/out_of Locus] town. ([ss Locus])"]

- [ex 040 "The company is [p en/out_of Manner--Locus] business. ([ss Manner--Locus])"]

See further discussion at [ss Manner].

###Reflexive PP Idioms 
Certain idiomatic constructions involve a preposition that requires a reflexive
direct object.

- **PERFORM-ACTIVITY <i>for</i> oneself.**

###1. When something is done for one’s own benefit rather than someone else’s:

- [ex 041 "I took a vacation [p en/for Beneficiary] myself ([ss Beneficiary])"]

###2. When something is done in a way that affords direct rather than second-hand information:

- [ex 042 "You should try out the restaurant [p en/for Agent--Beneficiary] yourself! ([ss Agent--Beneficiary])"]

- **PERFORM-ACTIVITY <i>by</i> oneself.**

###1. When something is done without accompaniment (the negation would be <i>[p en/with] others</i>):

- [ex 043 "I had lunch (all) [p en/by Special_Constructions] myself [‘alone’] ([ss Accompanier][^3])"]

###2. When something is accomplished without assistance:

- [ex 044 "I made the decision (all) [p en/by Manner] myself. ([ss Manner])"]

- [ex 045 "The computer rebooted all [p en/by Manner] itself. ([ss Manner])"]

- **BE <i>by</i> oneself.**
Alone; unaccompanied:

- [ex 046 "I am [p en/by Accompanier] myself right now. ([ss Accompanier])"]

##Ages

An individual’s age is a temporal property, licensing both [ss Time] and [ss Characteristic] prepositions:



- [ex 047 "a child [p en/of Characteristic] (age) 5 (years) ([ss Characteristic])"]

- [ex 048 "Martha was already reading <u>[p en/at Time]/[p en/by Time]/[p en/before Time]</u> (the age of<sub>[ss Identity]</sub>) 5 (years). ([ss Time])"]

[^1]: For ease of indexing,
[p en/'s] or [p en/s'] is preferred over possessive pronouns for s-genitive examples in this document.
[^2]: Cannot readily be paraphrased with [p en/their] because <i>children</i> is not referential,
but rather refers to a kind. This construction has been termed the <i>descriptive genitive</i> (quirk-85, pp. 322, 327--328).
[^3]: Though <i>myself</i>
is not literally accompanying <i>I</i>, the PP as a whole describes the nature of accompaniment (or lack thereof).
