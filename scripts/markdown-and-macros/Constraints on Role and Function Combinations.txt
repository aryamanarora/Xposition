The present scheme emerged out of extensive descriptive work with corpus data.
Given the abundance of rare preposition usages, this document does not claim
to cover every possible role/function combination for English,
let alone other languages.
Below are the few categorical restrictions that seem warranted for English.

##Supersenses that are purely abstract

[ss Participant], [ss Configuration], and [ss Temporal] are intended only to
organize subtrees of the hierarchy, and not to be used directly.

##Supersenses that cannot serve as functions

**[ss Experiencer], [ss Stimulus], [ss Originator], [ss Recipient], [ss SocialRel], and [ss OrgRole]
can only serve as scene roles in English.**
Though scenes of perception, transfer, and interpersonal/organizational relationships
are fundamental in language, they always seem to exploit construals from other domains
(motion, causation, possession, and so forth), at least insofar as
English preposition/case marking is concerned.

For example, [exref 001 Constraints_on_Role_and_Function_Combinations] is clearly [ss Recipient] at the scene level—Sam
acquires possession of the box—but also
fits the criteria for [ss Goal] because Sam is an endpoint of motion
(and [p en/to] frequently marks [ss Goal]s that are not [ss Recipient]s).
[exref 002 Constraints_on_Role_and_Function_Combinations] and [exref 003 Constraints_on_Role_and_Function_Combinations] reflect [ss Recipient--Agent] and
[ss Recipient--Gestalt] construals, respectively.

- [ex 001 "Give the box [p en/to Recipient--Goal] Sam. ([ss Recipient--Goal])"]

- [ex 002 "the box received [p en/by Recipient--Agent] Sam ([ss Recipient--Agent])"]

- [ex 003 "Sam[p en/'s Recipient--Gestalt] receipt of the box ([ss Recipient--Gestalt])"]

Though the [ss Goal] construal is arguably the most canonical expression of [ss Recipient],
there is no preposition with a primary meaning of [ss Recipient] independent of one of these other domains.

**Additional constraints on functions arise in the context of specific
constructions ([[ Special_Constructions]]).** For instance,

###1. the s-genitive requires either [ss Possessor] or [ss Gestalt] as its function ([[ Special_Constructions]]) ###2. passive [p en/by] requires [ss Agent] or [ss Causer] as its function ([[ Special_Constructions]]) 

##Supersenses that cannot serve as roles

In the present scheme, there are no supersenses that are restricted to serving as functions.

##No temporal-locational construals

**Temporal prepositions never occur with a function of [ss Locus], [ss Path], or [ss Extent].**

Languages routinely borrow from spatial language to describe time,
and spatial cognition may underlie temporal cognition (e.g., lakoff-80, nunez-06, casasanto-08).
A liberal use of construal would treat <i>arriving [p en/in] the afternoon</i> as [ss Time--Locus],
<i>sleeping [p en/through] the night</i> as [ss Duration--Path],
<i>running [p en/for] 20 minutes</i> as [ss Duration--Extent], and so forth.
However, for simplicity and practicality, we elect not to annotate [ss Locus], [ss Path], or [ss Extent]
construals on ordinary temporal adpositions. Thus:

- [ex 004 "arriving [p en/in Time] the afternoon ([ss Time])"]

- [ex 005 "sleeping [p en/through Duration] the night ([ss Duration])"]

- [ex 006 "running [p en/for Duration] 20 minutes ([ss Duration])"]

[ss Time--Direction] is possible, however, as are other atemporal functions:

- [ex 007 "Schedule the appointment [p en/for Time--Direction] Monday. ([ss Time--Direction])"]

- [ex 008 "January [p en/of Time--Whole] last year ([ss Time--Whole])"]

- [ex 009 "Will you attend Saturday[p en/'s Time--Gestalt] class? ([ss Time--Gestalt])"]

- [ex 010 "It took a year[p en/'s Duration--Gestalt] work to finish the book. ([ss Duration--Gestalt])"]

Note that the above is qualified to ‘ordinary temporal adpositions’.
**When the first argument of a comparative construction is marked with [p en/as],
the function is always [ss Extent], even if the scene role is temporal.**
See [[ Special_Constructions]].

##Construals where the function supersense is an ancestor or descendant of the role supersense

Ordinarily, if a construal holds between two (distinct) supersenses, these are from different branches of the hierarchy.
In a few cases, however, one is the ancestor of the other.

- **Role is ancestor of function.**

###1. Setting events or situations with a salient spatial metaphor are [ss Circumstance--Locus] or [ss Circumstance--Path].
###2. Fictive motion (the extension of a normally dynamic preposition to a static spatial scene) can warrant [ss Locus--Goal] or [ss Locus--Source], as discussed under [ss Locus].
###3. Complete contents of containers are [ss Characteristic--Stuff].


- **Function is ancestor of role.**

###1. Some s-genitives are annotated as [ss Whole--Gestalt]: see [[ Special_Constructions]].
###2. When a locative PP is coerced to a goal, as with <i>put</i>, [ss Goal--Locus] is used.
