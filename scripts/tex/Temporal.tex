\section{Temporal}

\shortdef{Abstract supercategory for temporal descriptions: 
\textbf{when}, \textbf{for how long}, \textbf{how often}, \textbf{how many times}, 
etc.\ something happened or will happen.}

\begin{history}
  The v1 category \sst{Age} (e.g., \pex{a child \p{of} five}) 
  was a mutual subtype of \psst{Temporal} and \sst{Attribute}. 
  Being quite specific and rare, for v2 it was removed; see \cref{sec:age}. 
  Combined with the changes to \psst{Time} subcategories (see below), 
  this reduced by~3 the number of labels in the \psst{Temporal} subtree, 
  bringing it to 7.
