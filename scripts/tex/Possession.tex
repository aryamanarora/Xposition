\section{Possession}

\shortdef{That which some \psst{Possessor} (animate or personified, e.g.~an institution) 
\textbf{has}, and which is not part of their body or inherent to their identity/character 
but could, in principle, be taken away.}

Sometimes called \emph{alienable} possession. 
The possession may be concrete or abstract, and temporary or permanent.

Prototypical prepositions are \p{with} and \p{without}:
\begin{exe}
\ex	People \p{with} money
\end{exe}

Attire is included here as well:
\begin{exe}
  \ex the kid \p{with} \choices{a vest\\makeup} (on)
  \ex the kid \p{in} a vest (\rf{Possession}{Locus})
\end{exe}

Immediate concrete possession uses an \psst{Accompanier} construal:
\begin{exe}
  \ex Hagrid exited the shop \p{with} (= carrying) a snowy owl. (\rf{Possession}{Accompanier})
\end{exe}

There is also a (negated) possession sense of \p{out}/\p{out\_of}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist} 
    \ex We are \p{out\_of} toilet paper.
    \ex Toilet paper? We are \p{out}.
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Paraphrase test: ``\psst{Possessor} POSSESSES \psst{Possession}'', 
``\psst{Possessor} is IN POSSESSION OF \psst{Possession}'', or 
``\psst{Possessor} HAS ON \psst{Possession}''. 
The latter is especially appropriate for immediate concrete possession.
