\section{EndTime}

\shortdef{When the event denoted by the governor finishes.}

Prototypical prepositions are \p{to}, \p{until}, \p{till}, \p{up\_to}, and \p{through}:
\begin{exe}
  \ex The show will run from 10 a.m. \p{to} 2 p.m.
  \ex Add the cider and boil \p{until} the liquid has reduced by half.
  \ex If we have survived \p{up\_to} now what is stopping us from surviving in the future?
  \ex They will be in London from March 24 \p{through} May 7.
\end{exe}

Note that simple \psst{Time} is used with verbs like \w{end} and \w{finish}: 
the event directly described by the PP is the ending, not the thing that ended.
\begin{exe}
  \ex The show will end \p{at} 2~p.m. (\psst{Time})
\end{exe}
