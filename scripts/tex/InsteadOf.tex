\section{InsteadOf}

\shortdef{A default or already established thing for which something else stands in 
or is chosen as an alternative.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex I ordered soup \choices{\p{instead\_of}\\\p{rather\_than}} salad.
  \ex \p*{Instead\_of}{instead\_of} ordering salad, I ordered soup.
  %\ex They replaced \uline{my old tires} with new ones. %#nonprep
  \ex The new shirts were gray \p{instead\_of} black.
  \ex\label{ex:subst-for} They substituted new tires \p{for} my old ones. [replacee; contrast \cref{ex:repl-with}]
\end{exe}
May be construed spatially:
\begin{exe}
  \ex I chose soup \p{over} salad. (\rf{InsteadOf}{Locus})
\end{exe}
But when \p{over} is used for a scene of liking or preference, see \psst{ComparisonRef}.
