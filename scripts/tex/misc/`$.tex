\section{OPAQUE POSSESSIVE SLOT IN IDIOM (\backposs)}\label{sec:possidiom}

Semantic supersenses are used where possible for genitive\slash possessive 
constructions, as discussed in \cref{sec:genitives}. 
However, there are a few idioms which require a possessive pronoun 
that does not participate transparently in any semantic relation; 
these are designated with the special label \backposs:
\begin{exe}\ex\begin{xlist}
  \ex I am eating on\_~~\p{my}~~\_own today.
  \ex She tried \p{her} best.
  \ex He's not \p{your} average baseball player.
  \ex Billy knows \p{his} ABCs!
\end{xlist}\end{exe}
