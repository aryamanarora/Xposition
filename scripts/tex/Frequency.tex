\section{Frequency}

\shortdef{\textbf{At what rate} something happens or continues, 
or the instance of repetition that the event represents.}

\begin{exe}
  \ex Guests were arriving \p{at} a steady clip.
  \ex The risk becomes worse \p{by} the day.
  \ex\label{ex:onOccasion} I see them \choices{\p{on}\_occasion\\\p{from}\_time\_to\_time}. [contrast \emph{on \dots occasion}, \cref{ex:onXOccasion}]
  \ex\label{ex:dailyBasis} I see them \p{on}\_a\_~~daily~~\_basis. (\rf{Frequency}{Manner}) [cf.~\cref{ex:bipartisanBasis}]
  \ex I keep getting the same message \p{over} and \p{over} again. %\nss{weak or strong MWE?}
\end{exe}
\psst{Frequency} is also used when an iteration is specified with an obligatory 
ordinal number modifier. 
If the ordinal number is optional, the preposition presumably receives another label:
\begin{exe}
  \ex\begin{xlist}
    \ex The camcorder failed \p{for} the third time. (\psst{Frequency})
    \ex They won \p{for} the third year in$_{\psst{Manner}}$ a row. (\psst{Frequency})
    \ex We arrived \p{for} our (third) visit. (\psst{Purpose})
  \end{xlist}
\end{exe}

Contrast: \psst{RateUnit}
